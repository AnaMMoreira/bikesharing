## Project Overview

	In this project an analysis of existing New York City Bike rental data in order to access how viable a starup of the same type would be in the city of Des Moines.  For ease of creating quick and appealing visualizations the free online platform Tableau was utilized.  Tableau is capable of creating visualizations and combine them into dashboards and storylines that can help summarize findings of analysis and aid in building an analysis.  

## Results:
   The following is a display of the the NYC Story that was built in Tableau for this project:

The first visualization shows where the Bike Sharing data points were located and also gives a sence for the dimention of each data point location (count of rides)

!NYC_Story1

The second visualization depicts a summary dashboard that shows that a total number of 2,344,224 Trips were reported and the the service is utilized almost evenly by customers of all ages and seems to be dominated by a singe gender which we will examine further in a later section of this report.  The location distributed also suggests that most of the bike sharing buisiness seens to be clustered in dowtoen Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn.

Looking at Ride Duration Figure 3 shows that most rides last less that one hour, and can be further seen in Figure 4 that Males seem to dominate the number of rides within that frst hour although most women and men alike take one hour rides.

Ploting the distribution of number of rides throughout the week it can be seen the hiest volume of rides occur on Thursday afternoon between 5 pm and 7 pm and Thursday Morning between 7 am and 10 am.  Mondays and Tuesdays seeem to also be very popular days again morning and afternoon rides prefered and the weekds are the next most popular days but the rides seem to be equaly distributed throughout the times of day.

Same Patterns can be seen in the data Regardless of gender. But seems that women tend to take more rides on the weekends.  See Figure 6A vs Figure 6B

As per customer type the data indicates that CitiBike Share Subscribers also take more rides than the general walk up customer as seen in Figure 7

With such high volume of rides and widely spread utilization schedules, a visualization of Total rides per times of day helps identify the best time to perform maintenance of the bikes. See Figure 8

! NYC_Story8

and as a way to identify the most used bikes and therefore the ones most likely needing maintenance a cluster plot of number of rides per bike ID can be seen in Figure 9

In order to further improve this analysis and aid in the implementation of a like buisness in Des Moines collection of data regarding land use such as hotels or other turist main attractions and or types of business where most data point exist in particular the high volume areas would be most helpful in determining where to locate the new business.
